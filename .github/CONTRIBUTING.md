Before you issue a pull request, be sure that you have the very latest code to prevent conflicts. 

Since the README.md is updated frequently to add moar oranjs, check your pull-request frequently to make sure that
you have merged the latest code into your branch (use Github commandline tools or desktop tools for this).

If you are solving an existing issue, reference it in the pull-request using the syntax `resolves [issue_number]`.

Have Fun!
